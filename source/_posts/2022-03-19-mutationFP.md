# Mutational heterogeneity in cancer and the search for new cancer-associated genes

[https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12213](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12213)

> After recognizing the problem of apparent false-positive findings, we reviewed the published literature and found that some of these potentially spurious genes have already been nominated as cancer-associated genes in recently published cancer genome studies: for example, LRP1B in glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma; CSMD3 in ovarian cancer; PCLO in DLBCL; MUC16 in lung squamous carcinoma11, breast cancer and DLBCL; MUC4 in melanoma; olfactory receptor OR2L13 in glioblastoma14; and TTN in breast cancer and other tumour types. We therefore set out to understand the source of the problem.

>As such, several large genes, including TTN, MUC19, MUC16, and KMT2D, had more false-positive results that could be screened by our study

>The high variance is due to two genes (TTN andMUC16) having extremely long lengths (35992 and 14508 aa respectively) compared to the rest of the protein coding genes.
